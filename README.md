# Dynamic Single Page Website Generator

This project demonstrates the generation and saving of a single-page website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the OpenAI API client.

## Overview

The project uses Node.js to interact with the OpenAI API. It dynamically generates HTML content that includes internal CSS styles and JavaScript functionality based on prompts sent to the API.

## Features

- **HTML Generation**: Utilizes the OpenAI API to generate HTML code.
- **CSS Integration**: Includes CSS styles within `<style>` tags in the generated HTML.
- **JavaScript Embedding**: Embeds JavaScript functionality within `<script>` tags in the generated HTML.
- **File Saving**: Saves the generated HTML content to a `.html` file locally.

## Usage

1. Customize the prompts and structure in the `index.js` file to tailor the generated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as needed.
2. Ensure your OpenAI API key is set in the environment variables or directly in the code (avoid committing sensitive information to version control).
3. Run the application to generate the HTML file containing the dynamically created single-page website.

## Resources

- [OpenAI API Documentation](https://beta.openai.com/docs/)
- [Node.js Documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)

### Notes:

- Customize the project further by adjusting the prompts and responses to fit specific project requirements.
- For security reasons, avoid exposing your API key in public repositories or environments.
- Contributions and feedback are welcome. Please refer to the project's [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.
